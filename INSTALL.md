# Installation Guide — Obsidian RAG Protocol

Get your AI agent reading your Obsidian vault in 3 steps.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** — the reference implementation uses only Python standard library (no pip install needed)
- **macOS or Linux** — tested on macOS Sequoia, should work on any Unix-like system
- **Obsidian vault** — a local folder with `.md` files (iCloud-synced vaults work fine)
- **An AI agent with filesystem access** — Hermes Agent, Claude Code, or any agent that can `read_file`

---

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Clone and test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wjameswen888/obsidian-rag-protocol.git
cd obsidian-rag-protocol
```

### 2. Run your first index build

```bash
python3 rebuild-vault-index.py \
  --vault ~/Documents/MyObsidianVault \
  --output ~/.hermes/vault-index.json \
  --scan wiki/projects wiki/career hermes-knowledge/
```

You should see:
```
✅ vault-index.json rebuilt: 12 entries (12 changed)
```

### 3. Verify the output

```bash
cat ~/.hermes/vault-index.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -40
```

You'll see a JSON object with `entries` — each containing `path`, `title`, `aliases`, and a `_content_hash`.

---

## Configuration

### Scan Directories

The `--scan` argument tells the indexer which subdirectories of your vault to scan. Format:

```bash
--scan DIR:AUTHOR DIR:AUTHOR ...
```

- `DIR` — path relative to your vault root
- `AUTHOR` — tag for who maintains this directory (`cc`, `hermes`, `vincent`, or `shared`)

**Example:**
```bash
--scan projects:cc career:cc my-agent-knowledge:hermes
```

**Why specify author?** If you use the bidirectional protocol (two agents sharing one vault), the `author` field helps each agent know which directory it's allowed to write to. If you only use one agent, just pick any label.

### Excluding Files

By default, the indexer skips:
- Directories named `archived`, `archive`, `log`, `modes`, `tracking`, or starting with `task-`
- Files matching `plan-*`, `*-progress`, `*-data-YYYY-MM`
- `index.md` and `README.md`

To exclude an individual note from the index, add this to its YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
rag_exclude: true
---
```

### Cutoff Days

By default, files older than 90 days are skipped. Change this with:
```bash
--cutoff-days 180   # index files up to 6 months old
```

### Hand-curated Aliases

For better search matching, you can provide a JSON file mapping entry IDs to custom alias lists:

```json
{
  "my-project": ["project", "my-project", "the thing I built"],
  "meeting-notes": ["meetings", "team-sync"]
}
```

Pass it with:
```bash
--alias-maps ~/my-alias-maps.json
```

---

## Triggering Rebuilds

The index gets stale unless something rebuilds it. The protocol doesn't mandate a single mechanism — pick one or two from below. Most working setups use a scheduled trigger as the primary path and the agent's staleness-prompt as a safety net.

### Path 1: System scheduler (cron / launchd / systemd timer)

The default. Set-and-forget; runs whether you're using the agent or not.

**Cron (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
# Add to your crontab (crontab -e):
0 9 * * * python3 /path/to/obsidian-rag-protocol/rebuild-vault-index.py \
  --vault ~/Documents/MyObsidianVault \
  --output ~/.hermes/vault-index.json \
  --scan wiki/projects:cc wiki/career:cc hermes-knowledge/:hermes \
  >> ~/.hermes/orp-rebuild.log 2>&1
```

The output redirect matters — `cron` swallows stderr by default and a corrupted-index warning would otherwise vanish.

**launchd (macOS)**

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.orp.rebuild.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.orp.rebuild</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/python3</string>
        <string>/path/to/rebuild-vault-index.py</string>
        <string>--vault</string>
        <string>/Users/you/Documents/MyObsidianVault</string>
        <string>--output</string>
        <string>/Users/you/.hermes/vault-index.json</string>
        <string>--scan</string>
        <string>wiki/projects:cc</string>
        <string>wiki/career:cc</string>
        <string>hermes-knowledge/:hermes</string>
    </array>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>9</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>0</integer>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/you/.hermes/orp-rebuild.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/you/.hermes/orp-rebuild.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load it:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.orp.rebuild.plist
```

### Path 2: Agent-internal scheduler

If your agent has a native scheduled-task system (Hermes Agent does, with cron-style task IDs), register the rebuild there instead of the OS-level scheduler. Survives across machine reboots in lockstep with the agent itself, and shows up in the same dashboard you check for other scheduled work.

```bash
# Hermes example — register a daily task that runs the rebuild script:
hermes schedule add \
  --cron "0 9 * * *" \
  --command "python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/rebuild-vault-index.py"
```

(Translate to your agent's equivalent — the operative point is "use the scheduler that's already running other tasks for this agent.")

### Path 3: Coupled to an upstream job

If you have other scheduled jobs that write content into the vault — a daily job-board scraper, a weekly market-snapshot generator — append the rebuild to their tail rather than running it independently. Keeps the index fresh-relative-to-the-write that just happened, and avoids stale windows where new vault content exists but the index doesn't see it yet.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Example: job-search-with-rebuild.sh
set -euo pipefail

# 1. Run the upstream job that writes new content to the vault
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/scan_jobs.py --output ~/Documents/Vault/hermes-knowledge/job-search/

# 2. Rebuild the index immediately so the new content is visible to agents
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/rebuild-vault-index.py
```

### Path 4: Staleness-prompt fallback

The protocol's Rule 4 (§4.3) — agent reads the index, sees it's ≥4 days old, asks the user. This is the safety net for when one of the scheduled triggers fails silently (machine asleep, cron daemon stopped, agent's task system paused). It's also the natural-language path: when the user says "refresh the index" or "rebuild the RAG," the agent runs the script directly.

No setup required beyond making sure the agent's system prompt includes the staleness check (see [Agent Integration](#agent-integration) below).

### Verifying the trigger

After your trigger path runs at least once:

```bash
# Health check the result
python3 orp_health.py --index ~/.hermes/vault-index.json

# Confirm an incremental rebuild reports 0 changed (no double-extraction)
python3 rebuild-vault-index.py ... --scan ...
# ✅ vault-index.json rebuilt: N entries (0 changed)
```

A non-zero `changed` count when nothing in the vault moved means something is mutating files behind your back (iCloud, git, backup software). Investigate before assuming the indexer is broken.

---

## Agent Integration

Once the index is built and auto-rebuilding, configure your agent to use it.

### Hermes Agent

Add these rules to your system prompt (SOUL.md or equivalent):

```
## Obsidian RAG Protocol

For any user question whose answer depends on personal context — what
we decided, what we discussed, what we know about X — your first tool
call MUST be:

  read_file(~/.hermes/vault-index.json)

Then:
1. Extract keywords from the user's question.
2. Match against `aliases` arrays in the index (substring, case-insensitive).
3. HIT → read_file the matched vault file(s) and use as context.
4. MISS → check `updated`. If ≥4 days old, offer to rebuild the index.
5. JSON parse error → ask the user to rebuild.

Skip the index for direct-action commands (run X, query a price, send a
message) and self-contained transformations (format this, edit that)
that don't depend on personal context.
```

The classifier is a behavioral test, not a keyword list — see protocol §4.1. Recall intent reads the index; execute intent doesn't.

### Claude Code

Add to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```
## Vault Context

Before answering any question that depends on personal context, read
~/.hermes/vault-index.json and match the user's keywords against the
aliases field (substring, case-insensitive). If a match is found, read
the referenced .md file and use it as context.

Skip the index for direct-action commands and self-contained tasks.
```

### Any Other Agent

The protocol is agent-agnostic. All you need:
1. **A way to read files** — `read_file`, `cat`, MCP filesystem server, or equivalent.
2. **A system prompt rule** — "for recall-intent queries, read `vault-index.json` first" (see §4.1 for what counts as recall intent).
3. **A rebuild trigger** — pick one or more from [Triggering Rebuilds](#triggering-rebuilds) above.

#### Reader reference

`orp_reader.py` ships in this repo as a reference implementation of the reader side of the protocol — alias matching (§4.2), staleness check, error handling. Use it as a library:

```python
from orp_reader import VaultIndex
idx = VaultIndex.load("~/.hermes/vault-index.json")
for entry_id, entry, matched_alias in idx.match("Coinbase Japan"):
    print(entry["path"])  # then read_file(entry["path"]) to get full note
```

Or as a CLI for ad-hoc shell glue:

```bash
python3 orp_reader.py status                      # exit 0 / 2 / 3
python3 orp_reader.py match "Coinbase Japan"      # tab-separated entry_id, path, matched alias
python3 orp_reader.py get coinbase-japan-analysis # full entry as JSON
```

Stdlib only. Drop it next to your agent's tooling and wire the match output into whatever read-file call your agent uses.

**Single source of truth tip.** Rather than copying matching rules into your agent's system prompt (where they'll drift over time as the protocol evolves), have the prompt instruct the agent to *call* `orp_reader.py match` and parse the output. Keeps the rules in one place — the reader file — instead of duplicated across every agent's prompt.

---

## Verifying It Works

### 1. Health check

The fastest single check — pass means schema is valid, index isn't stale, no orphan paths:

```bash
python3 orp_health.py --index ~/.hermes/vault-index.json
# OK: N entries, K.K KB, 0 failures, 0 warnings
```

If `--strict`, warnings (orphans, oversized index, short aliases) become non-zero exit. Use that mode in CI gates.

### 2. Check incremental rebuilds are healthy

Run the rebuild script again. If no files changed, you should see `0 changed`:

```bash
python3 rebuild-vault-index.py ... --scan ... --output ...
# ✅ vault-index.json rebuilt: 30 entries (0 changed)
```

A non-zero number every run means your files are being modified externally (iCloud sync, git, etc.) — check file watchers.

### 3. Test with your agent

Ask your agent: "What were we working on with [project name]?"

If the agent reads vault-index.json and references content from your vault — it's working.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Vault not found"
Check your `--vault` path. Use absolute paths (`~/Documents/Vault` not `../Vault`).

### "0 entries built"
- All scanned directories might be empty
- All files might be older than `--cutoff-days` (default 90)
- Files might match exclusion patterns — check the EXCLUDE_DIRS and EXCLUDE_FILENAME_PATTERNS lists in the script
- Files might have `rag_exclude: true` in frontmatter

### "Every run shows all entries changed" (no incremental)
This usually means files are being modified externally. On macOS, iCloud Drive or Time Machine can change file contents. The SHA256 hash catches real changes — if it's reporting changes, something IS modifying your files. Check:
- iCloud sync status
- Git auto-conversion (CRLF↔LF)
- Backup software touching timestamps

### "Agent doesn't read the index"
- Check your system prompt — the rule must explicitly say "first tool call"
- Some agents (Claude Code) may need the rule in their CLAUDE.md file
- The rule must distinguish "non-trivial" vs "trivial" queries

### "Index file corrupted"
```bash
# Just rebuild it
python3 rebuild-vault-index.py --vault ... --output ... --scan ...
```
