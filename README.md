# Obsidian RAG Protocol (ORP)

🌐 [English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

**If you use two or more AI agents on the same notes, they don't know what each other did. ORP is the shared notebook that keeps them in sync.**

**What you get:**
- **Stop re-explaining context every session.** Each agent sees, at startup, exactly what the others wrote since it last looked.
- **Find any past note by name, not by guess.** A small keyword index handles most "where did I write about X?" queries deterministically — no embeddings to tune. An optional semantic layer rescues the rest.
- **Your notes stay yours.** Agents append to a shared log; they never rewrite your existing notes.

### Is this for you?

| Your setup | ORP? |
|---|---|
| **Two or more AI agents writing to the same Obsidian-style vault** | ✅ This is exactly what ORP solves |
| One AI agent + you want it to curate / rewrite / "optimize" your vault | ❌ Use [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) or [obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain) instead |
| Just notes, no AI agents | ❌ Plain Obsidian is plenty |

ORP is a *coordination protocol*, not a wiki maintainer or a second-brain. If silent drift between your agents doesn't cost you anything real, this isn't your tool.

---

## The problem

Two AI agents working on the same Obsidian vault. Last night, Hermes wrote a market analysis to `hermes-knowledge/`. This morning, Claude Code has no idea — until you re-explain. Every. Single. Session.

The left hand doesn't know what the right hand did. **ORP is the shared blackboard between them.**

(If you have just one agent, this isn't your problem — you want a second-brain tool, not a coordination protocol. See the "Brutally honest" note above.)

## What it feels like with ORP

**Morning — session start.** You open Claude Code. Before you've typed anything, this auto-injects into the agent's context:

```
[ORP digest · agent=cc · since byte 184459 · 2026-05-12T09:13:15+09:00]
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-12T07:30 · note · stock-pulse 调研完成并归档
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-12T07:31 · write · wukong 文学向精读报告 — 8/8 endings 全量覆盖
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-12T08:46 · write · Oppenheimer 文学精读 v1.3.0 — 7/7 endings
```

Claude Code already knows what Hermes did overnight. You don't re-explain. The session starts with shared context.

**Mid-day — pull a past decision.** Later you ask: *"What did we decide about the Tokyo trip last month?"* The agent searches a small keyword index, finds the matched note in one tool call, and answers with the actual decision. No vault scan, no embeddings touched for this query.

**The whole loop runs on a JSON index that stays tiny** (under ~20 KB even for an 800-note vault, because frontmatter + cutoff filtering keep it compact). Local files only. Nothing leaves your machine unless you opt into the v1.6 semantic fallback for queries that miss the keyword index.

## How ORP relates to Karpathy's LLM Wiki and obsidian-second-brain

If you're already aware of [Karpathy's LLM Wiki gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) or the [obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain) Claude Code skill, this section is for you. They live in the same neighborhood — markdown vaults, Obsidian, AI agents — but they solve different problems. ORP is not a replacement for either; it can sit underneath either of them.

### One-line each

- **Karpathy's LLM Wiki** is a *pattern*: an LLM reads sources at ingest time, builds and **maintains** a wiki of interlinked markdown pages. Knowledge is compiled once, then kept current. Single agent + human curates.
- **obsidian-second-brain** is an *implementation* of that pattern, expanded: 31 commands, scheduled background agents, the wiki **rewrites itself** when new sources arrive, contradictions reconcile automatically. Single Claude Code session + human.
- **ORP** is a *protocol* for two AI agents to share context across one vault: alias-first keyword retrieval (no embeddings on the primary path; an optional v1.6 semantic fallback exists for queries that miss), byte-cursor session-start digest for cross-agent awareness, an append-only log for coordination. Vault content is yours; ORP doesn't rewrite it.

### Where they sit in the stack

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Application — knowledge synthesis            │
│ Karpathy's LLM Wiki · obsidian-second-brain  │
│ (ingest sources, mutate pages, lint, save)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Coordination — multi-agent state sync        │
│ ORP                                          │
│ (digest, log, cursor, alias matching)        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Storage — markdown + git                     │
│ (Obsidian vault, frontmatter, wikilinks)     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

ORP sits below the application layer. obsidian-second-brain could, in principle, run on top of ORP (with each scheduled agent identifying itself via `--agent <id>` and writing log entries through `orp_reader.py log`). Karpathy's pattern is single-agent so coordination doesn't apply — but if you ever ran two agents against a Karpathy-style wiki, ORP's coordination layer would do useful work.

### Side-by-side

| Axis | Karpathy's LLM Wiki | obsidian-second-brain | **ORP** |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **What it solves** | Knowledge compounds vs. RAG re-derivation | Vault that maintains itself | Two agents staying in sync over one vault |
| **Layer** | Application (knowledge) | Application (knowledge) | Coordination (state) |
| **Agent count** | 1 + human | 1 + human (CC) | 2 (CC + Hermes); extensible |
| **Mutates vault pages?** | Yes (LLM rewrites at ingest) | Yes, aggressively (rewrites + reconciles) | **No** (append-only log; vault content untouched) |
| **Retrieval** | LLM at query time | LLM at query time + cached pages | **Alias keyword index as primary** (deterministic, no LLM); v1.6 adds *optional* embedding fallback |
| **Embeddings / vector DB** | Not specified | Optional (Perplexity sonar for research) | **Optional, fallback-only** — alias-only deployments are fully supported |
| **Awareness primitive** | Read whole wiki / page graph | Auto-loaded `## For future Claude` preambles | Per-agent byte-offset cursor over `log.md` |
| **Implementation** | A 1500-word gist (idea file) | 31 commands, 4 cron agents, hook system | 8 single-file Python utilities (~3.6k lines · stdlib + optional `openai`/`tiktoken` for v1.6 vec layer) |
| **Multi-agent native?** | No | No | **Yes** |

### When to use what

- **You want one AI to maintain a wiki of your readings/notes that compounds over time.** Use Karpathy's pattern (or obsidian-second-brain if you want it pre-built).
- **You want one AI to manage your whole second brain — kanban, daily notes, contradiction reconciliation, scheduled agents.** Use obsidian-second-brain.
- **You have two or more AI agents writing to the same vault and they need to know what each other did.** Use ORP. (Pair it with either of the above if you also want knowledge synthesis.)

### What ORP is not trying to be

- **Not a wiki maintainer.** ORP doesn't summarize sources, doesn't update entity pages, doesn't reconcile contradictions. It's the layer that lets agents coordinate; what they write to the vault is their business.
- **Not a knowledge compounder.** No LLM-driven page mutation. ORP's append-only log is deliberately the opposite design choice from "wiki rewrites itself" — losing audit trail to gain compactness is a trade we won't make.
- **Not a Claude Code skill.** ORP is a filesystem protocol any agent can implement (CC and Hermes are reference implementations); skill packages built on top of it are application-layer work.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wjameswen888/obsidian-rag-protocol.git
cd obsidian-rag-protocol
bash hermes/install.sh
```

The installer asks for your vault path, sets up a daily cron job, and wires the indexer into Hermes. Three minutes, one terminal.

Not using Hermes? See [Other agents](#other-agents) — the integration is one prompt rule plus a cron job.

## What it does, in plain terms

- **Builds a small JSON index of your vault.** One file. ~15KB for 30 notes. Frontmatter (title, aliases, status, last action) extracted and laid out for fast lookup.
- **Rebuilds incrementally.** SHA256 content hashing — unchanged notes don't re-extract. Daily cron is fine.
- **Agent reads the index, not the vault.** First tool call on any non-trivial question is `read_file(vault-index.json)`. The agent never scans your full vault.
- **Fuzzy alias matching.** You curate the keywords (in frontmatter, or a side JSON). Match → agent reads that one note. Miss → falls through to "ask user".

## How it works

## What this is NOT

- **Not an automatic curator.** ORP doesn't rewrite your notes, build summaries, or "optimize" your vault. Coordination only.
- **Alias-first, not embedding-first.** Most queries use a deterministic keyword index — no LLM involved. v1.6 adds an *optional* semantic fallback for queries that miss the alias layer; alias-only setups stay fully supported and don't need an OpenAI key.
- **Not auto-tagging.** Aliases come from frontmatter or a curated map. The indexer never invents them — keeps retrieval predictable.
- **Not cross-machine sync.** Your vault, your laptop. iCloud / Syncthing / Dropbox handle the file layer; ORP runs on top.
- **Not a hosted service.** All scripts run locally on your machine. No account required. The optional v1.6 vec layer uses an OpenAI key you provide for `text-embedding-3-small` calls.

## Will this work for you?

| You have... | Fit |
|---|---|
| **Two or more AI agents writing to the same vault** | Yes — this is the canonical use case |
| One AI agent + want it to curate / rewrite your vault | No — use [Karpathy's pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) or [obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain) |
| An Obsidian vault | Yes |
| Some other folder of `.md` notes | Yes — ORP scans `.md` files; the "Obsidian" part is just the frontmatter convention |
| A vault with no frontmatter | Yes, with fallback aliases (filename stems). Add `aliases:` to important notes for sharper recall |
| 1000+ notes | Yes — `--cutoff-days` keeps the working set bounded; previously-indexed notes don't drop out |
| Use Hermes | Direct fit, `install.sh` handles it |
| Use Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, custom agent | Yes — ORP is a JSON file. See [Other agents](#other-agents) |
| Want semantic search as the *primary* interface | Use a vector DB. ORP's optional v1.6 vec layer is fallback-only — alias-first by design |

## Other agents

ORP is filesystem + JSON. Any agent that can:

1. Read a file on demand (`read_file`, `cat`, an MCP filesystem server, etc.)
2. Have a system prompt rule: *"For non-trivial queries, first read `~/.hermes/vault-index.json`. Match the query against `aliases` substrings. If a match is found, read the entry's `path`."*

…can use ORP. Schedule the rebuild via cron, launchd, systemd timer, or whatever your platform uses. Full per-agent guide in [INSTALL.md → Agent Integration](INSTALL.md#agent-integration).

## FAQ

**Does this send my notes anywhere?**
No. The indexer is Python stdlib only — no network calls. The index file lives at a path you control (default `~/.hermes/vault-index.json`).

**My vault has 800 notes. Will the index blow up?**
No. The index targets under 20 KB even on mature vaults because `--cutoff-days 90` (default) only re-indexes notes touched in the last 90 days, and each entry is just frontmatter fields — not full note bodies. The "~15 KB for 30 notes" example earlier is a fresh small vault; a mature 800-note vault stays around the same size because dormant notes don't get re-extracted. Previously-indexed notes that age out are kept (no silent drops).

**Do I need to add frontmatter to all my notes?**
No. The indexer falls back to first-paragraph extraction and filename-derived aliases. Adding `aliases: [...]` and `summary_points: [...]` to frequently-referenced notes makes retrieval sharper.

**What if two notes have the same filename in different folders?**
Disambiguated automatically with the scan-root prefix (`career-coinbase` vs `projects-coinbase`). The indexer warns on collision.

**What if the index file gets corrupted?**
Renamed to `<name>.broken-<ts>` and a fresh one is rebuilt. Hand-curated aliases in the broken file remain recoverable from the renamed copy.

**Can two agents share one vault?**
Yes — that's what `wiki/` and `hermes-knowledge/` are for in the example. Each agent writes to its own directory, both read everything. Atomic-append rules for the shared `log.md` are specified in §5.2 of the protocol.

## Day-to-day maintenance

The whole loop, end to end:

1. **You write a note in Obsidian.** Frontmatter (`title`, `aliases`, `summary_points`) is optional — no frontmatter still works, you just get filename-based fallback aliases.
2. **The index rebuilds automatically.** Pick a trigger from `INSTALL.md` — system cron, your agent's scheduler, coupled into another job, or just "agent prompts you when stale." Most setups use a daily scheduled rebuild plus the staleness prompt as a safety net.
3. **The agent reads the index on recall-intent questions.** "What did we decide about X?" → agent reads `vault-index.json`, fuzzy-matches "X" against your aliases, reads the matched note, answers with context.
4. **The agent prompts you when the index is stale.** ≥4 days old by default — you say "rebuild," it runs the script, you continue. No silent staleness.
5. **You health-check periodically.** `python3 orp_health.py` flags schema drift, orphan paths, oversized indexes. Run it in CI or after a vault reorg.

That's it. No retraining, no vector DB to maintain. (If you opt into the v1.6 semantic fallback, `vault_vec.py update` re-embeds only changed notes — same daily-cron pattern as the alias indexer.)

## ORP isn't read-only

The protocol surface is the index, but real ORP setups use the vault bidirectionally — agents both read existing notes and write new ones back, on triggers. A few patterns that work in production:

| Trigger | What gets written | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Daily job-board scrape | Top N matched listings for the day | `hermes-knowledge/job-search/daily-push-log.md` |
| Weekly market snapshot job | One-page recap with key signals | `hermes-knowledge/market/weekly-snapshot-{YYYY-Www}.md` |
| Cron-detected anomaly (price, on-chain, macro) | Notable-event entry | `hermes-knowledge/cron-knowledge/{category}/` |
| Agent finishes a substantive task | Decision log + open questions | `wiki/career/`, `wiki/projects/`, etc. |
| Inter-agent coordination | Append entry to shared log | `wiki/log.md` (under §5.2 atomic-append rules) |

These aren't part of the protocol contract — they're *applications* of it. Document the triggers your agent should fire, point each at a vault subdirectory, and your second brain accumulates without you copy-pasting. The index picks up the new entries on its next rebuild.

## Session-start sync (v1.4+)

Up to v1.3, ORP was pull-only: the index gets read when the user mentions an aliased keyword. That left a gap. If Hermes wrote a note at 3am while Claude Code was offline, Claude Code had no way to know — until the user happened to ask about it.

v1.4 closes the gap. Each agent calls `orp_reader.py digest --agent <id>` at session start and gets a short list of what's happened in the shared log since it last looked:

```
[ORP digest · agent=cc · since byte 118402 · 2026-05-07T09:15:00+09:00]
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-07T03:14:22+09:00 · write · cron-knowledge/timeout-investigation.md — 4 个 aux 模型 timeout 排查
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-07T08:05:11+09:00 · note · ORP v1.3 alias 批量补全 60 → 58
🦅[hermes] 2026-05-07T08:30:00+09:00 · done · vault-health-check skill 长期化重写
```

That's the whole protocol surface for the push side. Implementation:

- `wiki/log.md` is the existing collaboration channel (§5.2). v1.4 standardizes its entry format with ISO-8601 timestamps and a closed action vocabulary so a byte-offset cursor parses cleanly.
- Each agent has a per-agent cursor at `<vault>/.orp/cursor-<id>.json`. Different agents see digests of the same shared log from their own positions.
- Agents write to the log with `orp_reader.py log --agent <id> --action <write|note|done|decision> "msg"` — never by hand-editing — so the format stays consistent and the cursor doesn't choke.
- Best-effort by design: vault unavailable, log missing, corrupt cursor → silent exit 0. A digest failure must not block agent startup.

No mtime scans, no daemon, no polling. The append-only log is the only state. Wiring is one hook per agent — see [INSTALL.md → Session-Start Digest](INSTALL.md#session-start-digest-v14).

Adding a third agent (Codex, Cursor, your own): pick an id, write events through `orp_reader.py log --agent <id>`, wire the session-start hook to call `digest --agent <id>`. No structural vault changes.

**v1.5 update — auto-log via PostToolUse + Stop hooks.** Dogfooding v1.4 showed CC agents reliably miss the "call `orp_reader.py log` after vault writes" rule (0 entries logged across ~41 vault writes in one week, while Hermes logged 47 across the same window). v1.5 ships an optional two-hook mechanism: a PostToolUse stager records each vault edit to a per-session pending file, and a Stop hook flusher writes ONE summary log entry per turn (action `note`, prefix `auto:`). One entry per turn, not per edit — keeps signal tight. Hermes-style background agents that already log reliably don't need it. See [INSTALL.md → Auto-log Hooks](INSTALL.md#auto-log-hooks-v15) and protocol §5.6.

## Compared to alternatives

| Approach | Tradeoff vs ORP |
|---|---|
| Paste vault into system prompt | Simple but blows context budget every conversation; no incremental update |
| Pure vector DB (LlamaIndex, mem0, Letta, cognee, supermemory) | Embedding-first means opaque retrieval, chunking tax, drift over re-embeds. ORP runs alias-first (deterministic, in this maintainer's dogfood most queries hit the alias layer cleanly) and uses vec only as the fallback — most queries don't touch an embedding at all |
| **CodeGraph et al. (tree-sitter code-graph MCPs)** | Index source-code AST + call graph for a single coding agent's exploration. ORP indexes prose — notes, decisions, research — for multi-agent coordination. They can coexist on one machine for different jobs (CodeGraph for the codebase, ORP for the vault) |
| **Vendor memory (Claude memory, ChatGPT memory, Cursor memory)** | Locked to a single vendor; opaque storage; single-agent. ORP is plain markdown on disk, multi-vendor, multi-agent — your notes don't disappear if you switch tools |
| Obsidian Smart Connections plugin | Single-user, query-only, vector-only — runs inside Obsidian. ORP is multi-agent write + read + coordinate; vault never depends on the plugin running |
| Obsidian MCP server | Read-time access, but no curated alias layer — agent has to grep/search the whole vault per query |
| **ORP** | Alias-primary deterministic retrieval (you control the alias breadth) + opt-in semantic fallback + RRF fusion + append-only multi-agent log. Tradeoff: no agent-driven vault rewrites — coordination only, not curation |

ORP wins when (a) you have ≥2 agents writing to the same vault, (b) you'd rather curate ~5 aliases per important note than tune embedding chunking, and (c) you want most queries to be deterministic with semantic as the safety net, not the primary ranker.

## What's new in v1.5.1 + v1.6

If you've used ORP before and want to see what changed (jargon explained inline):

**v1.5.1 — cross-agent protocol primitives** (May 2026)
- **Identity metadata in log entries.** Each log line can now carry `session=<id> trigger=<category>` — so when you read the shared log a week later, you can tell *which* of an agent's sessions wrote each entry, not just *which agent*. Six fixed action types (`write` / `note` / `done` / `decision` / `intent` / `issue`) replace the previous free-form vocabulary.
- **Cursor sanity check.** Each agent saves a byte-offset cursor into the shared log so it can incrementally read only what's new. v1.5.1 verifies the cursor isn't stale before reading — checks file size, content hash of the last 4 KB, and last-modified time. If anything is off (log was truncated, restored from backup, etc.), the agent does a full re-read and prepends a warning instead of silently rewinding.
- **Note status field.** Every entity now has a `status` (`verified` / `captured` / `draft` / `stale` / `archived` / `blocked`) so retrieval can default to "skip stale + archived." Closes the v1.5 ambiguity where agent-generated stub notes were indistinguishable from human-written canonical notes.

**v1.6 — retrieval + hygiene** (May 2026)
- **Optional semantic fallback.** When your phrasing diverges from your aliases ("AI compounding" instead of "knowledge graphs"), an OpenAI embedding layer rescues the query. ~$0.023 to embed a fresh 800-note vault; ~$0.000001 per query. Stays opt-in — alias-only setups keep working unchanged.
- **Rank fusion when both layers run.** [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) (a 2009 academic result that's now a search-engine standard) combines alias + vec rankings. Same-doc agreement across both rankers naturally boosts top results without needing a similarity threshold.
- **Backlinks.** `vault_lookup.py backlinks <target>` lists every note that wikilinks to a given note — across both `wiki/` and `hermes-knowledge/` namespaces. No third index; ORP just walks the vault on each call (~0.1s on 800 notes).
- **Embedding-model versioning.** A small `vault-vec.about.json` sidecar tracks which embedding model built the index. If the dimension changes (different model entirely), the index won't load (fail-closed — embedding spaces can't mix). If only the model name changes (same dim), you get a warning and the index keeps working.
- **Stale + duplicate report.** Weekly observational scan into `.orp/reports/stale-dedup-<date>.md`. Flags candidates by age and by lowercased-title overlap. ORP never auto-mutates; you decide what merges and what stays.

**Telemetry from one user's 5-day window** (32 lookups · 2 agents · ~800 notes): **94% alias hit · 100% vec hit · 0 all-miss · 0 write conflicts**. This is single-vault dogfood data, not a general benchmark — but it confirms alias as the primary ranker and vec as the rare-case safety net, not the other way around.

## Status

Spec is at v1.6. The repo ships **8 single-file Python utilities** (~3.6k lines total: stdlib + optional `openai` + `tiktoken` for the v1.6 vec layer) plus 2 example hook scripts.

What's running:
- An ~800-entry vault on a single laptop, six months and counting
- Two agents (Hermes + Claude Code) sharing one vault with separate write directories
- Daily scheduled rebuild plus staleness-prompt fallback
- Session-start digest in both agents' startup hooks (v1.4) · identity meta + 3-field cursor sanity (v1.5.1)
- Auto-log PostToolUse + Stop hooks on the Claude Code side (v1.5) — fixes the empirical "CC writes vault but doesn't log" gap surfaced in v1.4 dogfood
- Entity state machine deployed with 217-entity backfill (v1.5.1) — 216 captured + 1 verified
- Two-layer retrieval (alias + optional vec + rank fusion) on CC side (v1.6) — 5-day single-vault dogfood: 94% alias hit · 100% vec hit · 0 all-miss (caveat: 32 lookups, N=2 agents, not a general benchmark)
- Backlinks query · embedding-model versioning · stale/dup report scaffold (v1.6, observational)

Honest framing: this is a hand-rolled spec from one user's setup. There are no third-party adopters yet — the spec is offered as something you might find useful, not as a community standard. If you adopt it, file issues; the spec moves with real usage.

Intentionally not done:
- No automated alias generation — "thin alias coverage" stays a human-curation signal
- No GUI / dashboard
- No agent-driven vault rewriting (the append-only log is deliberate counter-design to "vault rewrites itself")
- No N≥3 quorum / leader protocols — current cursor + log design assumes N=2. Will revisit when a third agent appears
- No automatic dedup cleanup — v1.6 report flags candidates only; the user decides what merges and what stays
