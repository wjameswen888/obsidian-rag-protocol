Give your AI agent long-term memory by pointing it at your Obsidian vault. No embeddings, no vector DB, fully local.

## The problem

You ask your AI agent, "what did we decide about X last month?" — and it has no idea. You re-explain. Every. Single. Session.

You already wrote it down in Obsidian. The agent just can't see it.

## What it feels like with ORP

```
You: 我们之前对 Coinbase Japan 的判断是？

Agent: Based on wiki/career/coinbase-japan-analysis.md
       (last updated 2026-04-11):
       • status: archived
       • 判断: 規制リスク過大、後発参入劣勢明顯
       • last action: 2026-04-11 写入分析笔记
       Source: alias "Coinbase" matched.
```

The agent reads a single ~15KB JSON index, fuzzy-matches your question against aliases you control, and pulls only the matched note. No embeddings. No external service. Nothing leaves your machine.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wjameswen888/obsidian-rag-protocol.git
cd obsidian-rag-protocol
bash hermes/install.sh
```

The installer asks for your vault path, sets up a daily cron job, and wires the indexer into Hermes. Three minutes, one terminal.

Not using Hermes? See [Other agents](#other-agents) — the integration is one prompt rule plus a cron job.

## What it does, in plain terms

- **Builds a small JSON index of your vault.** One file. ~15KB for 30 notes. Frontmatter (title, aliases, status, last action) extracted and laid out for fast lookup.
- **Rebuilds incrementally.** SHA256 content hashing — unchanged notes don't re-extract. Daily cron is fine.
- **Agent reads the index, not the vault.** First tool call on any non-trivial question is `read_file(vault-index.json)`. The agent never scans your full vault.
- **Fuzzy alias matching.** You curate the keywords (in frontmatter, or a side JSON). Match → agent reads that one note. Miss → falls through to "ask user".

## How it works

```

```

Full protocol: [OBSIDIAN-RAG-PROTOCOL.md](OBSIDIAN-RAG-PROTOCOL.md). Schema, alias resolution, multi-agent collaboration, error handling, all specified.

## What this is NOT

- **Not embedding-based.** No vectors, no semantic search. If a question doesn't match an alias, ORP doesn't pretend to retrieve it.
- **Not auto-tagging.** Aliases come from frontmatter or a curated map. The indexer never invents them — keeps retrieval predictable.
- **Not cross-machine sync.** Your vault, your laptop. iCloud / Syncthing / Dropbox handle the file layer; ORP runs on top.
- **Not a hosted service.** One Python script (stdlib only) plus a JSON file. No account, no API key.

## Will this work for you?

| You have... | Fit |
|---|---|
| An Obsidian vault | Yes |
| Some other folder of `.md` notes | Yes — ORP just scans `.md` files, the "Obsidian" part is the frontmatter convention |
| A vault with no frontmatter | Yes, with fallback aliases (filename stems). Add `aliases:` to important notes for better recall |
| 1000+ notes | Yes — `--cutoff-days` keeps the working set bounded; previously-indexed notes don't drop out |
| Use Hermes | Direct fit, `install.sh` handles it |
| Use Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, custom agent | Yes — ORP is a JSON file. See [Other agents](#other-agents) |
| Need true semantic search ("notes related to X") | No — use LlamaIndex, Mem0, or similar |

## Other agents

ORP is filesystem + JSON. Any agent that can:

1. Read a file on demand (`read_file`, `cat`, an MCP filesystem server, etc.)
2. Have a system prompt rule: *"For non-trivial queries, first read `~/.hermes/vault-index.json`. Match the query against `aliases` substrings. If a match is found, read the entry's `path`."*

…can use ORP. Schedule the rebuild via cron, launchd, systemd timer, or whatever your platform uses. Full per-agent guide in [INSTALL.md → Agent Integration](INSTALL.md#agent-integration).

## FAQ

**Does this send my notes anywhere?**
No. The indexer is Python stdlib only — no network calls. The index file lives at a path you control (default `~/.hermes/vault-index.json`).

**My vault has 800 notes. Will the index blow up?**
The index targets <20KB. With `--cutoff-days 90` (default), only notes touched in the last 90 days are indexed. Older notes that are already in the index stay (they don't get dropped just because they aged out).

**Do I need to add frontmatter to all my notes?**
No. The indexer falls back to first-paragraph extraction and filename-derived aliases. Adding `aliases: [...]` and `summary_points: [...]` to frequently-referenced notes makes retrieval sharper.

**What if two notes have the same filename in different folders?**
Disambiguated automatically with the scan-root prefix (`career-coinbase` vs `projects-coinbase`). The indexer warns on collision.

**What if the index file gets corrupted?**
Renamed to `<name>.broken-<ts>` and a fresh one is rebuilt. Hand-curated aliases in the broken file remain recoverable from the renamed copy.

**Can two agents share one vault?**
Yes — that's what `wiki/` and `hermes-knowledge/` are for in the example. Each agent writes to its own directory, both read everything. Atomic-append rules for the shared `log.md` are specified in §5.2 of the protocol.

## Compared to alternatives

| Approach | Tradeoff vs ORP |
|---|---|
| Paste vault into system prompt | Simple but blows context budget every conversation; no incremental update |
| Vector DB / embeddings (LlamaIndex, Mem0, Letta) | Semantic match works, but heavy: chunking, embedding cost, opaque retrieval, drift over time |
| Obsidian MCP server | Read-time access, but no curated alias layer — agent has to grep/search the whole vault per query |
| **ORP** | Aliases are explicit (you control them), retrieval is deterministic, latency near zero. Tradeoff: alias-keyword matching only, no semantic match |

ORP wins when you'd rather curate 5 aliases per important note than tune embedding chunking.

## Status

Spec is at v1.1. Reference indexer is one Python file (~250 lines, stdlib only).

What's running:
- Daily cron rebuild on a 30-entry vault, three months
- Two agents (Hermes + Claude Code) sharing one vault, separate write directories

Intentionally not done (yet):
- No semantic / fuzzy-vector search
- No automated alias generation
- No GUI / dashboard
